This iOS application demonstrates multithreading by downloading three random images from Google simultaneously and displaying their individual download progress bars in real time. Each image download runs on a separate thread, ensuring smooth and efficient parallel execution. This project highlights the use of URLSession, GCD (Grand Central Dispatch), and UI updates on the main thread for a responsive user interface.

ðŸ”§ Features:

Downloads 3 images simultaneously using multithreading
Shows real-time progress bars for each image
Clean and responsive UI
Demonstrates safe main-thread UI updates
ðŸ§ª Note:
For testing purposes, image URLs are fetched directly from public sources. No Google API or scraping is used.

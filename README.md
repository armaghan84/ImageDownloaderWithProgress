This iOS application demonstrates multithreading by downloading three random images and displaying their individual download progress bars in real time. Each image download runs on a separate thread, ensuring smooth and efficient parallel execution. This project highlights the use of URLSession, GCD (Grand Central Dispatch), and UI updates on the main thread for a responsive user interface.

ðŸ”§ Features:

* Downloads 3 images simultaneously using multithreading
* Shows real-time progress bars for each image
* Demonstrates safe main-thread UI updates

ðŸ§ª Note:
For testing purposes, image URLs are fetched directly from public sources. No Google API or scraping is used.
